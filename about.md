# About the Comic

My Grandmother’s Chair is based off a poem my grandma wrote about her own grandparents. It gave me such a strong feeling that it inspired to try and make my first comic, something I’ve wanted to do for years.

# About the Author

I'm an animator and illustrator from Brisbane, Australia, living for the past few years in Munich, Germany. This is where I post my comics.
